# Hasami-Shogi-Game
This was the portfolio project for my CS162 class. It is an implementation of variant 1 of the game Hasami Shogi. I used pygame to create a very basic GUI, where the Shogi pieces are represented as red and black triangles. You are able to move by click-and-holding on a piece and then releasing the mouse button when you are on desired square to be moved to. Enjoy!
